# [Project 1: To identify differentially expressed genes in microarray from GEO42568](.github/workflows/static.yml)

# 1. Downloaded and untarred the supplementary files for GSE42568
# 2. List and gunzip all .CEL files in the GSE42568 directory.
# 3. Background Correction:Use the justRMA() function for background correction.
# 4. Data Normalization: Extract phenotypic data from the obtained set and normalized column names in the expression data.
# 5. Save the normalized expression data to a file named "visual_exp_data.txt."
# 6. Convert Matrix to DataFrame:
# 7. Install Bioconductor Packages and create Design Matrix:
# 8. Obtain significant genes using topTable and extract DEGs
# 9. Plot a volcano plot using ggplot2 to visualize DEGs.
